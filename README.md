A tiny WebWorker polyfill for the `file://` protocol

_Think [pseudo-worker][1] but using an `iframe` instead of `XMLHTTPRequest`.
This polyfill should be mostly spec-compliant and even supports `importScripts`.
It should pretty much be a drop-in replacement, at least for modern browsers
which include a constructable `EventTarget` and `Promise`._

## Installation

``` sh
npm install iframe-worker
```

## Usage

You can either use `iframe-worker` programmatically:

``` js
import { IFrameWorker } from "iframe-worker"
```

... or use the polyfill which automatically mounts on `file://` locations:

``` js
import "iframe-worker/polyfill"
```

... or use [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com) __(recommended)__:

``` html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/iframe-worker/polyfill"></script>
```
